1,"What is RAG?","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate informed responses.","#rag-system","concept"
2,"FAISS Overview","FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It's optimized for billion-scale datasets.","#rag-system","tool"
3,"Sentence Transformers","Sentence Transformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings. It's built on top of Hugging Face Transformers.","#llm-chatbot","tool"
4,"OpenRouter Benefits","OpenRouter provides a unified API to access multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. It offers cost optimization and fallback options.","#llm-chatbot","service"
5,"Agent Architecture","AI agents use a perceive-plan-act loop. They break down complex tasks into steps, execute them sequentially, and adapt based on results.","#agent-demo","concept"
6,"Embedding Models","Embedding models convert text into dense vector representations. Popular models include all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (fast, 384-dim) and text-embedding-ada-002 (high-quality, 1536-dim).","#rag-system","concept"
7,"Vector Databases","Vector databases like FAISS, Pinecone, and Weaviate enable efficient similarity search over embeddings. They use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms.","#rag-system","tool"
8,"Prompt Engineering","Effective prompts are clear, specific, and provide context. For RAG, include retrieved context and explicit instructions to avoid hallucination.","#llm-chatbot","technique"
9,"Context Window Management","LLMs have token limits (4K-128K). Manage context by truncating old messages, summarizing, or using sliding windows.","#llm-chatbot","technique"
10,"Agent Safety","Safe agents require sandboxing, explicit user consent, step limits, timeouts, and transparent execution. Never allow unrestricted file or network access.","#agent-demo","safety"
11,"Semantic Search","Semantic search finds documents by meaning rather than keywords. It uses embeddings to compute similarity between queries and documents.","#rag-system","concept"
12,"LLM Providers","Major LLM providers include OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), and Meta (Llama). Each has different strengths and pricing.","#llm-chatbot","service"
13,"Multi-Step Reasoning","Multi-step reasoning breaks complex problems into simpler sub-problems. Agents use chain-of-thought prompting to show their work.","#agent-demo","technique"
14,"Deployment Options","Deploy AI apps using Vercel (serverless), Docker (containerized), or Kubernetes (orchestrated). Consider latency, cost, and scalability.","#general","deployment"
15,"Evaluation Metrics","Measure RAG quality with precision@k, recall@k, MRR, and NDCG. Measure generation quality with BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation.","#rag-system","evaluation"
